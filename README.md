# About this list

This is a validated, cleaned, and up-to-date list of domains used by disposable email services that are still functioning at the time of validation.

# What is disposable email?

Disposable email addresses are known as DEA or dark mail. It is a kind of service that generates a unique or random email address that is used for every contact or entity.

This repository includes a collection of domains that are used by the disposable email services.

The administrators could use this list to prevent potentially fraudulent activities.

# Approach

This list has been validated by scanning the MX records. Only the domains that still had valid MX records were kept in this list. Duplicated items were removed.

# Source

The raw data was periodically collected from the following sources:

- [disposable-email-domains](https://github.com/ivolo/disposable-email-domains)
- [disposable-email-provider-domains](https://gist.github.com/michenriksen/8710649)
