## What is a disposable email?

A [disposable email address](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disposable_email_address), often referred to as DEA, is a type of service that creates unique or random email addresses for each use or entity. Disposable email addresses are typically used only once and are not intended for receiving future emails.

While disposable email addresses can be used for spam, they also serve legitimate purposes. Some users employ them to protect their privacy or to manage their online identities. As such, the use of disposable email addresses isn't inherently negative or malicious. 

The repository herein contains a collection of domains associated with active disposable email services, validated at the time of the scan. Administrators might use this list to mitigate potential risks or to ensure that their users are capable of receiving future communications, when it is a crucial aspect of the service provided.
