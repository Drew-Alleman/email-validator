A list of disposable email domains that are still functioning. 

# Disposable email

Disposable email addresses are known as DEA or dark mail. It is a kind of service that generates a unique or random email address that is used for every contact or entity.

This repository includes a collection of domains that are used by the disposable email services.

The administrators could use this list to prevent potentially fraudulent activities.

# Approach

This list had been filtered by scanning the MX records. Only the domains that still had valid MX records were kept in this list.

# Sources

The raw data was originally sourced from [disposable-email-domains](https://github.com/ivolo/disposable-email-domains).
