# Disposable Email Domain List

This is a list of domains used by temporary or disposable email services.

This list is daily updated and validated by MX scan. It's made as short as possible.

## What is disposable email?

[Disposable email addresses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disposable_email_address) are known as DEA or dark mail. It is a kind of service that generates a unique or random email address that is used for every contact or entity.

This repository includes a collection of domains that are used by the disposable email services that are still functioning at the time of the validation.

The administrators could use this list to prevent potentially fraudulent activities.
